Using the RC
============

#.  Turn on the Remote Controller by holding down both power switches.
    The screen with turn on and a chime will play.

#.  Make sure all switches (SwA, SwB, SwC, SwD) are placed in the UP position on startup for safety.

#.  Enable manual control of the base by setting the second switch from the left (SwB) to its MIDDLE position.

#.  Use the left stick up/down to command forwards or backwards linear velocities.

#.  Use the right stick left/right to command counter-clockwise or clockwise angular velocities.
